        <p>Hi! My name is Mira. I immigrated in United States with my husband in 2005. I raised my two beautiful boys as stay at home MOM.
        I had done my schooling in India and had graduated in 2004 with Bacholer in Computer Applications degree. First initial few years
        I spent in USA thinking that I would go back to my home country and start my career all over again. Unfortunately that day never came
        into our lives and we decided to make this beautiful country our home.</p>
        <p>At one point when my boys had grown up and started their schooling, I thought of starting my professional career again
        which I had put on hold for a decade now. Being in tech industry, I came up with an opportunity to work for At&T as Kronos Business Analyst.
        I had enjoyed the most at my first job in USA at it had given me a seemless opportunity to learn and refresh my skills which I had 
        aquired but had never used. I was given oppotunity to work on key funtionality of one of the biggest projects. I also worked for High Ridge Brands as Navision Fuctional Analyst.
        <br>
        After working on few projects as business analyst I felt that I still need to reskill myself being in this evolving industry where new technologies 
        has put their roots in the ground and that's the reason here I am!</p1
